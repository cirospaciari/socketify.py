# First Ideas for SSGI

```python

    # send chunk of data, can be used to perform with less backpressure than using send
    # total_size is the sum of all lengths in bytes of all chunks to be sended
    # connection will end when total_size is met
    # returns tuple(bool, bool) first bool represents if the chunk is successfully sended, the second if the connection has ended
